Index of Economic Freedom is an annual ranking of the economic freedom of 184 countries from property rights to entrepreneurship published by The Heritage Foundation.


The Heritage Foundation responded with a statement on Saturday, saying that Carlson’s segment contained “several false, outrageous, and unfounded accusations against The Heritage Foundation.”
Rob Bluey, vice president of communications at Heritage, released the following statement in response:

The Heritage Foundation brands itself as a beacon of the intellectual conservative establishment.
In reality, the think tank serves as a pipeline of hate to the Trump administration, dedicating significant energy to extremist policy recommendations to deny access to abortion and birth control and to harm LGBTQ people.


Index of Economic Freedom measures economic freedom of 184 countries based on trade freedom, business freedom, investment freedom, and property rights.

Ferrero Rocher was invented by an Italian chocolatier named Ferrero SpA and was introduced in 1982.
The word “Ferrero” came from its inventor’s last name and Rocher is a French word meaning “rock”.
Ferrero SpA’s other products include the very famous Nutella, Tic Tac candy, and the Kinder Surprise.


The Ferrero’ Family was the first Italian manufacturer after World War II to open production sites and offices abroad in the confectionary sector, turning the Company into a truly international Group.
These first and decisive steps forward were thanks to the products “invented” by Pietro Ferrero and his son Michele, who was then very young.

The Leatherman brand is expertly crafted with pride and integrity in the Pacific Northwest, where a diverse and rugged landscape allows for optimal product testing.
Leatherman tools come with a 25-year limited warranty.
As a leading innovator in the industry, there is a reason the Leatherman brand makes some of the best selling tools in the ...

Leatherman produces four sizes of what we all recognize as a multi-tool: keychain, pocket, full, and heavy-duty.
Each is fitted with anywhere from 6 to 21 tools, from scissors and bottle-openers to rulers and screwdrivers, and, of course, a wide variety of blades.


The Leatherman Wave Plus is the most sold Leatherman multi-tool by far.
We understand why.
It has practically all tools you could need on a daily basis and with the available accessories you can easily make it even more versatile.
It offers the famous Leatherman quality for a great price.


The Leatherman was notoriously tight-lipped, usually speaking only in grunts, mutters and a few words of what seemed to be broken English.
It was said that the occasional phrase in French could be discerned, though, leading people to believe that French was his native language.

The best TCL TV in the budget category that we've tested is the TCL 5 Series/S535 2020 QLED.
Like the higher-end TCL 6 Series/R635 2020 QLED, this one has a QLED panel, resulting in a wide color gamut for HDR content.
However, it doesn't get nearly as bright, so HDR content doesn't pop the way it should, and it doesn't perform well in bright rooms because its reflection handling is just decent.

Mars

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.


Mars’ atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide (about 96 percent), with minor amounts of other gases such as argon and nitrogen.
The atmosphere is very thin, however, and the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars is only about 0.6 percent of Earth’s (101,000 pascals).


Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury.
In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".
The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to ...

Mars has worked on coral reef restoration for the past 13 years, investing more than $10 million in research, builds, and community engagement.
The results have been dramatic: in just three years, coral cover has increased from 5% to 55% and the recovered reefs have seen an abundance of fish and biomass.


NASA’s real-time portal for Mars exploration, featuring the latest news, images, and discoveries from the Red Planet.


As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours).
Martian days are called sols—short for "solar day."
A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.
Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.


With a radius of 2,106 miles, Mars is the seventh largest planet in our solar system and about half the diameter of Earth.
Its surface gravity is 37.5 percent of Earth’s.

Mars, fourth planet in the solar system in order of distance from the Sun and seventh in size and mass.
It is a periodically conspicuous reddish object in the night sky.
There are intriguing clues that billions of years ago Mars was even more Earth-like than today.


Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the next planet beyond Earth.
It is, on average, more than 142 million miles from the Sun.
Mars turns on its axis more slowly than Earth does.
So, a day on Mars is 24.6 hours.
Since this planet is farther from the Sun than Earth, one revolution of Mars around the Sun is a longer trip.

In 1869, Florentine Ariosto Jones, an American from Boston, utilized the world-renowned Swiss watch making craftsmen and rented his first factory in Schaffhausen, Switzerland.


At the time when our business first became involved in the emerging vintage wristwatch scene in the early 1980s, IWC or, to give the company its full title, the International Watch Company, was a niche brand that was known to a relatively small number of serious collectors, but entirely unrecognised by the general public.

Cox isn’t offering any “doorbuster” deals to speak of at the moment, but we think its 30-day trial period and lack of multiple-year contracts on some plans easily qualify as cool stuff.


Whether you want to manage bills and payments, view and upgrade your services, or check up on service appointments, it's all possible with My Account.


With Cox My Account, access your account information, pay your bills, and more.


A note about channel numbers: Cox TV listings—and those of other cable TV providers—vary depending on your area.
So if you want to know the channel number for a particular network, the best way to find it is to visit the Cox channel lineup page.
If you can’t find it there, contact Cox customer support and ask a rep.


Cox Cable TV.
With Cox, you have the freedom to choose the TV package that works for you and your family.
You can choose between Cox Contour TV, and Cox Contour Flex TV.
If you want hundreds of channels and the most HD, then Cox Contour TV is for you.
It includes over 140+ TV channels, and 50 music channels.


Cox Internet-only Deals.
With speed up to 150 Mbps for $49.99 a month, the Internet Preferred 150 plan is Cox’s best internet-only deal.
Admittedly, there are plans with more speed at the same price from some of Cox’s biggest competitors (i.e., Verizon Fios), but Cox is the only one that offers nationwide hotspots.

The Pinarello Prince is a capable road bike.
The bike has several features that translate down from Pinarello's Dogma F12, used by Tour de France racers.
It has an asymmetric frame, internal cable routing, a wheel-shaped concave downtube and fork flaps.
The Prince is not a race bike, though.


Pinarello’s bar tape leant toward the thin side.
Frustrating T20 star-shaped bolts on stem and bottle cage bosses are absent from most multitools.
Bottom line The Grevil is heavily invested in Pinarello’s aero heritage.
This extensive research has resulted in a bike that sports an undeniably unique frame shape.
To some, this seemed ugly.

An annual review is a moment (or two) to pause and consider how you spent your year –– the highs, the lows, and everything in between.
The highs and lows of a year.
James Clear, a productivity expert and the author of Atomic Habits, has publicly shared a annual review from 2013 to 2019:

Annual Reviews is a nonprofit publisher dedicated to synthesizing and integrating knowledge for the progress of science and the benefit of society.


Annual Reviews Rankings in Journal Citation Reports (Clarivate Analytics) 2020 Release of Journal Citation Reports.
The 2020 Edition of the Journal Citation Reports® (JCR) published by Clarivate Analytics provides a combination of impact and influence metrics from 2019 Web of Science source data.


If you send that memo a few weeks before your annual review is due, it won't make much difference.
And it isn't that your boss has already written the review.
Unless your company has a corporate culture that places great value on the review process, many bosses start to write the review on the day it's due.

The tone isn't really reminiscent of anything else Blackstar do.
It's a classic low wattage non-master volume amp, and it has great chimey cleans at low volume that really crunch up as you push the volume.
It also has an EF86 preamp, similar to a vintage Vox or Matchless amps, which delivers a fatter, punchier tone.

Perhaps this explains why Blistex sells more than $100 million worth of their “medicated” lip balm every year!

Vertigo

Vertigo is a sensation of feeling off balance.
If you have these dizzy spells, you might feel like you are spinning or that the world around you is spinning.


Vertigo is the sensation that either your body or your environment is moving (usually spinning).
Vertigo can be a symptom of many different illnesses and disorders.
The most common causes of vertigo are illnesses that affect the inner ear, including:

Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving.
With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving.
Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion.
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).


Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself.
It's the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning.
This feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks.


Vertigo is a condition where a person has the sensation of moving or of surrounding objects moving when they are not.
Often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement.
This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, or difficulties walking.
It is typically worse when the head is moved.


Vertigo is a symptom of a range of conditions.
It can happen when there is a problem with the inner ear, brain, or sensory nerve pathway.
Dizziness, including vertigo, can happen at any age, but it...

Overview Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo — the sudden sensation that you're spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning.
BPPV causes brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness.
It is usually triggered by specific changes in your head's position.


Vertigo is dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving.
The condition can feel similar to motion sickness, but it’s not the same as lightheadedness.

The E-mu Modular System is an analog modular synthesizer built by E-mu Systems in 1974.
It competed with synthesizers such as the ARP 2500, ARP 2600, and Moog modular synthesizers, although E-mu designed the instruments for mostly universities and notable musicians who submitted custom configuration requests.
The Modular System's polyphonic keyboard and sequencer are controlled by a microprocessor.


Impetus.
E-mu Systems was founded in 1971 and began business as a manufacturer of microprocessor chips, digital scanning keyboards and components for electronic instruments.
Licensing this technology gave E-mu ample funds to invest in research and development, and it began to develop boutique synthesizers for niche markets, including a series of modular synthesizers and the high-end Audity system.


E-mu Emax (1986) The Emax was a line of samplers, developed, manufactured, and sold by E-mu Systems from 1986 to 1995.
Sold alongside their more expensive Emulator II and III samplers, the Emax line was conceived after the release of the Akai S-612 and Sequential Prophet 2000, and was designed to compete for the lower end of the sampling market.

Lion

The lion (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa.
It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane.
With a typical head-to-body length of 184 to 208 cm (72 to 82 in) they are larger than females at 160 to 184 cm (63 to 72 in).


Lion, large, powerfully built cat that is second in size only to the tiger.
The proverbial ‘king of the beasts,’ the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times.
Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland.


Online visitors can catch a glimpse of the Smithsonian's National Zoo's lions on the Lion Cam .
Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey.
Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black.

With Sunny Pawar, Abhishek Bharate, Priyanka Bose, Khushi Solanki.
A five-year-old Indian boy is adopted by an Australian couple after getting lost hundreds of kilometers from home.
25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family.


Lion prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals.
In a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together.
In prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing.
Usually all the lionesses in the pride are related—mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and sisters.

It captures the horror, danger, loneliness, and vast existential meaningless ...

How to use smart in a sentence.


SMART is a well-established tool that you can use to plan and achieve your goals.
While there are a number of interpretations of the acronym's meaning, the most common one is that goals should be S pecific, M easurable, A chievable, R elevant, and T ime-bound.


SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-based.
Each element of the SMART framework works together to create a goal that is carefully planned, clear and trackable.
You may have set goals in your past that were difficult to achieve because they were too vague, aggressive or poorly framed.


A SMART goal is used to help guide goal setting.
SMART is an acronym that stands for S pecific, M easurable, A chievable, R ealistic, and T imely.
Therefore, a SMART goal incorporates all of these criteria to help focus your efforts and increase the chances of achieving your goal.
SMART goals are: S pecific: Well defined, clear, and unambiguous.


Serving since 1967, SMART is Southeast Michigan’s only regional public transportation provider.
SMART offers convenient, reliable, and safe transportation for Macomb, Oakland and Wayne Counties.


SMART criteria are commonly associated with Peter Drucker 's management by objectives concept.
Often the term S.M.A.R.T. Goals and S.M.A.R.T. Objectives will surface.
Although the acronym SMART generally stays the same, objectives and goals can differ.
Goals are the distinct purpose that is to be anticipated from the assignment or project.

A Brief History of the Marque.
Italemmezeta was the predecessor of Italjet, a firm established in 1960 by Italian racer Leopoldo Tartarini, son of Egisto Tartarini.
Early machines employed MZ engines and the logo incorporated the letters MZ.
The firm name changed to Italjet, reportedly in 1967, but the motorcycles had been branded Italjet for some time before that.


The Italjet Diablone uses a Bafang geared front hubmotor, which is an EU-compliant 250W pedelec system.
The battery is just behind the seat, and the controller is located just below the battery.
The black leather case in the frames triangle is only for storage.

Wurlitzer

Wurlitzer Jukeboxes.
The Rudolph Wurlitzer Company, usually referred to as simply Wurlitzer, is an American company started in Cincinnati in 1853 by German immigrant (Franz) Rudolph Wurlitzer.
The company initially imported stringed, woodwind and brass instruments from Germany for resale in the United States.


The Wurlitzer was invented by radio engineer and inventor Benjamin Miessner.
Originally, the design was an amplified, conventional upright piano.
The Wurlitzer company took that design, but replaced the strings of the piano with struck steel reeds.
The earliest versions for sale were the Wurlitzer 100 series.


The Wurlitzer Room.
Great atmosphere for weddings, and all large events.
The room can split in half for bridal and baby showers too.
The Wurlitzer Room offers a full bar, music, 3 HD Projectors with three 10 foot screens, microphone with podium, and connectivity via Wi-Fi HDMI.
Additional area: Giant illuminated patio with seating and a fire pit.


The North Tonawanda plant was a fitting site for Mr. Wurlitzer’s recollections — it was his leadership there that guided Wurlitzer through the manufacture of band organs, to photo players, to theatre organs, to jukeboxes, and finally electronic organs.


Wurlitzer pianos are a popular choice for students, home enthusiasts and professional musicians alike.
Our available Wurlitzer pianos include a range of types, costs and conditions.

The Jewish Publication Society (JPS) is about the great books of Judaism....

The New Jewish Publication Society of America Tanakh, first published in complete form in 1985, is a modern Jewish 'written from scratch' translation of the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible into English.
It is based on revised editions of earlier publications of subdivisions of the Tanakh such as the Torah and Five Megillot which were originally published from 1969–1982.


PREFACE.
The following is from the preface to the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English: The sacred task of translating the Word of God, as revealed to Israel through lawgiver, prophet, psalmist, and sage, began at an early date.


The Tanach.
Though the terms "Bible" and "Old Testament" are commonly used by non-Jews to describe Judaism's scriptures, the appropriate term is "Tanach," which is derived as an acronym from the Hebrew letters of its three components: Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim.

BÃ¤renreiter

Bärenreiter’s large catalogue comprises vocal and instrumental music of all genres from the Renaissance to the present day, including orchestral music and numerous Complete Editions.
The renowned encyclopedia „Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart“ has brought Bärenreiter much acclaim as well as their books on music and their educational ...

Together with his duet partner Silke-Thora Matthies, he is a prize-winner of the Munich Competition and has released the world's first complete recording of Brahms's works for piano duet.
In addition to the Serenades for piano four-hands, opp.
11 and 16 (BA 6570 and 6571), he has already edited many of Brahms's solo piano works for BÃ¤renreiter.


German label founded in 1960 by the Bärenreiter-Verlag (Bärenreiter music publishing house).
In 1994 Musicaphon was bought by the musicologist Dr. Rainer Kahleyss.
Label Code: LC 0522 / LC 00522 Publisher: Bärenreiter-Verlag

BÃ¤renreiter took on a limited republication of some compositions in the 1950s and garnered a small amount of interest, but Distlerâ€™s chromatically altered, poly-pandiatonic music landed like a thud in an era when most European art music was caught up in a kind of analogy to quantum mechanics.

Norco Bicycles

Find Focus.
There’s a few good reasons why the 2020 Optic won the Pinkbike Mountain Bike of the Year – but the only one that matters is that it’s faster and more fun than any 125mm Trail bike should be.
Explore the Optic View Models.


Norco Bicycles was founded in Port Coquitlam, BC in 1964.
Starting as a one-man operation in a small warehouse and remodeled chicken coop, Norco has stayed true to their roots, which has helped them grow into a global company with over 150 bike models.
All of Norco’s bikes are designed and tested in Canada, and proven around the world.


Norco Bicycles - Fanatik Bike Co. No Detail Too Small - Norco strives to create progressive bicycle designs that maximize performance.
In carefully selecting components that complement their designs, Norco makes great efforts to meet their own high expectations for ride quality.
They ensure that every one of their bicycles passes a stringent ...

In addition to adult bikes, Norco also makes bicycles for young riders.
They organize these into Youth and Kids models, depending on the wheel size.
The Youth models are basically scaled-down adult models with 24″ and 20″ wheels.
These include Fluid, Storm, Rampage, and Check models, so the selection is pretty decent.


The Norco Charger VLT is the electric bike that riders need who don't have room, or the budget for a massive quiver of bikes.
It isn't weighed down by the added weight and complexity of rear suspension, and it is equipped with all the accessory mounts that riders will need for commuting, city riding, and weekend trail excursions.


Norco is a Canadian bicycle manufacturer with over 50 years of experience building all types of bikes from road and hybrid to MTB and BMX.Based in Port Coquitlam, BC, Norco began life in 1964 when Bert Lewis began building bicycles in a rural, converted chicken coop.
The brand now sells over 130 different bikes to cyclists in 25 countries worldwide.. The brand was one of the first companies to ...

Hogarth Press

The Hogarth Press was a British publishing house founded in 1917 by Leonard Woolf and Virginia Woolf.
It was named after their house in Richmond (then in Surrey and now in London), in which they began hand-printing books.. During the interwar period, the Hogarth Press grew from a hobby of the Woolfs to a business when they began using commercial printers.


The printing press was duly installed on the dining room table at their home Hogarth House, which gave the Press its name.

The Hogarth Press was eventually given over entirely in 1938 to her husband Leonard and his business partner, who in turn took the press to the publishing company Chatto and Windus to secure a career and funding.
Chatto and Windus was later bought by Random House, and the name of Hogarth Press used for one of its edgier, modernist fiction imprints.

Butterfly

Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant leaves and spend practically all of their time searching for and eating food.
Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, eating ant larvae.


The lepidopteran life cycle has four stages: egg, larva ( caterpillar ), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (imago).
The larvae and adults of most butterflies feed on plants, often only specific parts of specific types of plants.
Chrysalis of the mourning cloak butterfly ( Nymphalis antiopa) suspended by the cremaster, head downward.


Butterfly migration is best exemplified by the Monarch, which is widely known to migrate in the fall to overwintering sites in California and Mexico.
But in the United States, several other butterfly species engage in lesser migration distances.
Some of these are the Buckeye, the Painted Lady, the Purple Wing, the Great Southern White, the ...

A butterfly is a usually day-flying insect of the order Lepidoptera.
They are grouped together in the suborder Rhopalocera.
Butterflies are closely related to moths, from which they evolved.
The earliest discovered fossil moth dates to 200 million years ago.


Learn all about the wonderful world of butterflies!
We have gardening tips, science facts, photos, butterfly quotes and so much more!


What is a Butterfly?
Butterflies are beautiful, flying insects with large scaly wings.
Like all insects, they have six jointed legs, 3 body parts, a pair of antennae, compound eyes, and an exoskeleton.
The three body parts are the head, thorax (the chest), and abdomen (the tail end).
The butterfly's body is covered by tiny sensory hairs.


The butterfly is not protected by poisonous compounds and doesn't really resemble known mimicry models like the orange monarch or the black-and-blue pipeline swallowtail, but it has become the single most common butterfly in city and countryside.


Butterfly Conservation is a British charity devoted to saving butterflies, moths and their habitats throughout the UK.

The Double Cola Company.
August 28 at 9:48 AM ·.
An article in City Scope’s Annual Business Issue recently showcased The Double Cola Company’s very own CEO, Alnoor Dhanani.
Dhanani discusses how his success has come from an ideal that has been instilled in his life since childhood: “Perseverance commands success”.


Double-Cola is the name of a carbonated soft drink.
It is manufactured by The Double Cola Company, headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Double-Cola is considered a regionally manufactured US brand of soft drink, predominantly distributed east of the Mississippi River.
It is also available in select international markets.


Double-Cola Co.'s ranking as the fourth largest cola brand at the dawn of the 21st century was a testament to its success in the 20th century, but for some business analysts the story of Double-Cola was a story of missed opportunities, a tale of what the company might have become had it done things differently.

The Encyclopaedia of Islam First Edition Online (EI1) was originally published in print between 1913 and 1936.
The demand for an encyclopaedic work on Islam was created by the increasing (colonial) interest in Muslims and Islamic cultures during the nineteenth century.


On the Relevance of the Humanities. "
The humanities—including the study of languages, literature, history, jurisprudence, philosophy, comparative religion, ethics, and the arts—are disciplines of memory and imagination, telling us where we have been and helping us envision where we are going." -
American Academy of Arts and Sciences.


The Encyclopaedia of Islam (Second Edition) Online sets out the present state of our knowledge of the Islamic World.
It is a unique and invaluable reference tool, an essential key to understanding the world of Islam, and the authoritative source not only for the religion, but also for the believers and the countries in which they live.

RANKING OF ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS .
Appendix 1.
For book publishers there is no internationally accepted system of ranking.
This system is based on those used by CERES and SENSE (www.sense.nl) I refereed book publications: A: Refereed book publications published by the world top of publishers

B Brill B Butterworth-Heinemann B Callwey B Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press B Curzon Press B Duke University Press B Earthscan B Edward Elgar B Elsevier Science B Frank Cass B Garrisberg MacMillan B Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. B Harper & Row Publishers, Inc./Ballinger Publishing Co. B Harwood Academic Publishers B Hart B Heinemann

There are a number of approaches to ranking academic publishing groups and publishers.
Rankings rely on subjective impressions by the scholarly community, on analyses of prize winners of scientific associations, discipline, a publisher's reputation, and its impact factor (particularly in the sciences).
