What Is Virginity & The Hymen? | Losing Your Virginity
A virgin is someone who’s never had sex — but it’s not quite as simple as it seems. That’s because sex means different things to different people, so virginity can mean different things, too. A lot of people think that having penis-in-vagina sex for the first time is how you lose your virginity.

What Is Mars? | NASA
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the next planet beyond Earth. It is, on average, more than 142 million miles from the Sun. Mars turns on its axis more slowly than Earth does. So, a day on Mars is 24.6 hours. Since this planet is farther from the Sun than Earth, one revolution of Mars around the Sun is a longer trip.
